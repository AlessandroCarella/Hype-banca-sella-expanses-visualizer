The project is still a work in progress but you can see in the todo file the next things i will implement.
As far as right now 3 pages have been implemented:
* Upload Csv page -> to upload the bank given csv to elaborate the data and shape the data in a program needed way.
* Select categories page -> page where the user can select how to categorize the names in their expanses file.
* Main chart page -> in this page there is the chart showing the expanses for a selected year or month.

The main features i would like to implement in the future are:
* autosorter for the expanses categories by mapping the names based on a categorization database or a similar solution.
* prediction chart in the main chart page to allow the user to make predictions on next months based on their previous expanses.
* imporvement on the upload csv code page to give the user better hints on errors and various.
* mapping for other banks to allow the use of the webapp from other bank users
